### ABSTRACT

Self balancing systems are a bit of a novelty, but there is a lot of potential applications. Currently there are segways and hoverboards, the self balancing scooters. Recently Boston Dynamics developed a self balancing two wheeled robot that could carry packages around a warehouse. Our robot is a simple demonstration of this technology. 

### INTRODUCTION

Self balancing systems need to read sensor input and adjust accordingly. This means a gyroscope sensor so the system can read if it is upright and our software on a microcontroller is the interface between the sensor and the wheels. 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create a robot that will be able to maintain an upright position under changing circumstances. It should be able to balance on a slope or right itself after being pushed. 

### PROPOSED SOLUTION

We use an arduino uno, two geared motors and a controller, and a 3 axis gyroscope/accelerometer. Our program will read input from the sensor and adjust the wheels as necessary in order to maintain an upright position. Ideally the robot would be able to self calibrate the upright position however this robot is going to be set manually when we have it attached to a console.
