# Project Scope 

### Team Members: Ashton Chatelain, Jesse Duran, Joseph Bradford

### 1 Team Name: Robot Bullies

### 2 Inspiration for the project: [*self balancing robot*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5DNjcppkYU&feature=youtu.be) 

### 3 Basic task(s) to be performed
 - Aquire hardware - UPDATE only need wire and to print the 3D frame
 - Assemble robot
 - Test system
 - [Create White Paper, basic outline begun here](whitepaper.md)

### 4 List # and type of microcontrollers to be used
 - Arduino uno

### 5 List additional equipment needed
 - wiring: needs to be picked up asap
 - frame: being 3D printed this week
 - hardware robot frame eg screws, wood/plastic: need screws to mount sensor and arduino
 - sensors - gyroscope: aquired
 - servos and wheels: aquired
 - battery: aquired
 
### 6 Team member assignments and timeline
- Jesse: 3D print frame by saturday 4/6
- Joseph: purchase wire and gather hardware by 4/6
- Ashton: begin whitepaper
